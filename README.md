# 🐍 Python for Everybody - Jupyter Notebooks  

This repository contains my notes and exercises from the **Python for Everybody** specialization by the University of Michigan on Coursera. Each Jupyter Notebook corresponds to a different course within the specialization, covering key concepts, examples, and hands-on exercises.  

## 📌 Specialization Overview

The specialization consists of five courses:  
✅ 1. **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)** – Basic Python concepts, variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.  
✅ 2. **Python Data Structures** – Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and file handling.  
🚧 3. **Using Python to Access Web Data** – Web scraping, APIs, and regular expressions.  
🕓 4. **Using Databases with Python** – SQL, SQLite, and database integration with Python.  
🕓 5. **Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data** – Final project applying all concepts learned.
